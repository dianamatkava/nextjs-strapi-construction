        <br><br>
        <li class="py-2">Flooding from external sources —  heavy rain, river overflows, or rising groundwater usually require a separate flood insurance policy.</li>

        <li class="py-2">Mold and mildew — unless directly caused by a sudden water incident, these are often excluded from standard coverage.</li>

          The first reason is installation errors. Even high-quality pipes can leak if connections are poorly sealed or fittings are over-tightened or under-tightened. Over time, such weak points may start to let water through.​
          <br><br>
          Another factor is manufacturing defects. Microcracks in the material, deformations, or thread defects might be unnoticed during installation but can lead to leaks over time.​
          <br><br>
          It's also important to consider material compatibility. Connecting incompatible metals can cause corrosion that deteriorates pipes from the inside. Additionally, using unsuitable gaskets or fittings can reduce the hermeticity of connections.​
          <br><br>
          We shouldn't overlook high water pressure. Strong pressure or water hammer can weaken even new pipes, causing damage.​
          <br><br>
          To prevent leaks, it's crucial not only to choose quality materials but also to install them correctly. Pressure testing the system before commissioning can help identify potential issues early.
